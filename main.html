            A skilled thief with the rare ability to "extract" information from people's minds while they dream must pull off the impossible: inception, the implantation of another person's idea into a target's subconscious. Dom Cobb is the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable.
